This project is a small Python program that checks how strong a password is.
You type a password into the window, press a button, and the program tells you if the password is Weak, Medium, or Strong.

It gives points for things like:

being at least 8 characters long

having uppercase letters

having lowercase letters

having numbers

having special symbols


The more rules the password follows, the stronger it is.
